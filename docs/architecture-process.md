# dmgCtrl — Architecture: Process & Testing

> **See also:** [Overview](architecture-overview.md) | [Implementation Details](architecture-implementation.md)

## 1. Workflow & Development Process

### Branching strategy

| Branch type | Naming convention | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Feature | `feature/<short-description>` | New functionality |
| Bug fix | `bug/<short-description>` | Defect corrections |
| Refactor | `refactor/<short-description>` | Code improvements without behaviour change |
| Docs | `docs/<short-description>` | Documentation only |

All development happens on short-lived branches. `main` is the stable, deployable branch.

### PR workflow

1. Branch from `main`
2. Develop and commit on the feature branch
3. Open a pull request targeting `main`
4. All tests must pass (enforced by GitHub Actions)
5. Merge when ready

### Commit messages

Commit messages follow the pattern `<branch-name> <description>`, e.g.:

```
bug/hyperspace-art-resolution improves resolution of hyperspace art
```

---

## 2. CI/CD

### Pipeline: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Triggered on push to `main` and on pull requests targeting `main`. Three sequential jobs:

```
test → build → deploy
```

| Job | Steps |
|---|---|
| `test` | `npm ci` → `npm test` (Vitest) |
| `build` | `npm ci` → `tsc` → `vite build` |
| `deploy` | Upload `dist/` to GitHub Pages |

### Deployment target

The app is hosted on **GitHub Pages** at `/dmgCtrl/`. The `base` config in `vite.config.ts` is set to `/dmgCtrl/` to ensure all asset paths are correct.

### What triggers the pipeline

- Push to `main` — runs all three jobs and deploys on success
- PRs targeting `main` — runs `test` and `build` jobs; deploy is skipped

## 3. Analytics

### Cloudflare Web Analytics

A Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon is embedded in `index.html`. It fires on every page load (i.e. every app start) and provides:

- App load counts over time
- Unique visitor counts (privacy-preserving, no cookies, no consent banner required)
- Countries, browsers, devices

The beacon token (`aaed1e18376f4bdd9f56a0050acce291`) is a public identifier — it is not a secret and is safe to commit.

Custom event tracking (game starts, base popularity) is not covered by the Cloudflare beacon, which only records page loads. That is handled separately by the Worker + InfluxDB pipeline (see issues #97, #98, #99).

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Philosophy

Tests verify behaviour, not implementation. Hook tests cover logic in isolation; container/screen tests cover integration between hooks and views; `App.test.tsx` covers top-level navigation and feature flows.

### Test types

| Type | Location | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Hook unit tests | `src/test/use*.test.ts` | Vitest, `renderHook`, `act` |
| Utility unit tests | `src/test/*.test.ts` | Vitest |
| Component tests | `src/test/*.test.tsx` | Vitest, React Testing Library, `userEvent` |
| End-to-end (within app) | `src/test/App.test.tsx` | Same |

### Mocking approach

- External APIs are mocked with `vi.stubGlobal('fetch', ...)` — no real network calls in tests
- localStorage is mocked with `vi.stubGlobal('localStorage', ...)` to test caching paths
- All mocks are torn down with `vi.unstubAllGlobals()` in `afterEach`
- `useUserSettings` is mocked with `vi.mock('../hooks/useUserSettings', ...)` in tests that exercise preference-gated behaviour; `vi.hoisted` is used for mock values that need per-test control
- `useFavourites` is mocked with `vi.mock('../hooks/useFavourites', ...)` in setup screen tests; `vi.hoisted` provides per-test control over `favourites`, `addFavourite`, `removeFavourite`
- `App.test.tsx` mocks `useBases` at the module level (`vi.mock('../hooks/useBases', ...)`) so data is available synchronously; this allows the tests to focus on navigation logic rather than data loading. The loading screen transitions immediately when data is ready; `waitFor` with the default timeout handles any async React batching.

### Running tests

```bash
npm test          # run once
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
```

Always use `npm test`. The `npx vitest run` form has a cache glitch that causes spurious first-run failures.

### Coverage expectations

- All hooks must have unit tests
- All utility functions must have unit tests
- All screens must have container/view tests covering primary interaction flows
- New features must include tests before merging

## 5. Future Improvements

### Architecture

- **Global state** — React Context is now used for user settings; if the app grows further, a lightweight state manager (e.g. Zustand) may be worth adopting for broader shared state
- **Multi-game support** — the `Base` type and `useBases` hook are SWU-specific; a game-agnostic data abstraction layer would be needed for additional games

### Data

- **Backend / sync** — currently all data is fetched from third-party APIs; a first-party backend could provide more reliable image hosting, faster response, and support for user-specific data (favourites, history)
- **Art coverage** — swu-db.com CDN does not yet host hyperspace art for all sets; `hyperspaceArtHiRes` will become more reliable as their index grows

### UI

- **Theming system** — CSS custom properties are now in place; per-game themes (e.g. X-Wing aesthetic) could be implemented by swapping the `:root` values at runtime
- **Animations** — damage counter and screen transitions could benefit from subtle animations
